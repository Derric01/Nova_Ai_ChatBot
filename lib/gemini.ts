The largest known structure in the observable universe is the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall. This is a gigantic supercluster of galaxies that spans approximately 10 billion light-years across! To put this in perspective, the entire observable universe is estimated to be about 93 billion light-years in diameter, which means this single structure spans more than 10% of the entire observable universe.

What makes this even more mind-boggling is thinking about the scale: each of those galaxies contains billions of stars, and many of those stars have their own planetary systems. The sheer scale of cosmic structures challenges our understanding of how the universe formed and evolved after the Big Bang.

Would you like to hear more space facts, or perhaps learn about something specific like black holes, exoplanets, or space exploration?`,

Here are some truly mind-bending facts about our universe that might change how you see reality:

## üí´ Scale & Size
- If the Sun were the size of a white blood cell, the Milky Way would be the size of the continental United States
- There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all Earth's beaches combined‚Äîapproximately 10¬≤¬≥ stars
- Light from the most distant galaxies we can observe has been traveling for over 13 billion years

## ‚è≥ Time & Physics
- Time passes faster at your head than at your feet due to Earth's gravity (time dilation)
- Due to the universe's expansion, galaxies can move away from each other faster than light speed
- If you could somehow survive inside a black hole, you might see the entire future of the universe unfold before your eyes in an instant

## üå† Cosmic Phenomena
- We're made of star stuff‚Äînearly all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were forged inside stars
- There's a giant cloud of alcohol in Sagittarius B‚Äîcontaining enough ethyl alcohol to fill 400 trillion trillion pints of beer
- Some diamonds in space are larger than Earth‚Äîone diamond exoplanet is estimated to be five times the size of Earth

## üß† Mind-Bending Concepts
- According to quantum physics, particles can be in multiple places simultaneously until observed
- The observable universe is just a tiny fraction of the entire universe‚Äîwe can only see the light that's had time to reach us
- If you could fold a piece of paper 42 times, it would reach the moon‚Äî103 times would make it larger than the observable universe

Which of these would you like to learn more about? I can explain any of these phenomena in more detail!`,
